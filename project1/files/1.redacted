H █ call was trading for █ on monday . today it was █/█ . the market 's view of probability of h going crazy has certainly changed in past █ hours and that has to be reflected in h/j . slafontaine @ globalp.com on ██████████ █:█:█ PM To : slafontaine @ globalp.com cc : ███████████ @ enron.com Subject : re : spreads mkt getting a little more bearish the back of winter i think-if we get another cold blast jan/feb mite move out . with oil moving down and march closer flat px wide to jan im not so bearish these sprds now-less bullish march april as well .
